Very few defendants have constitutional challenges to the statute under they were convicted that have a reasonable prospect of succeeding on appeal.

So when they were talking about what -- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty plea, they say, well, where you have a right not to be hailed into court at all, they say where the charge is one that the state cannot constitutionally prosecute; that last one is from Menna, and they say where the court had no power to enter the conviction; that last one is from Broce. So, in all three of those cases, the language used is where, you know, in the end you find that the -- that you've -- you've -- you've done the facts, you've satisfied the elements, but still the state can't prosecute you constitutionally or properly.

And, third, I don't think anything that this Court said in Blackledge and Menna reflects that they're really the tip of the iceberg that would allow claims by all sorts of defendants. In those cases, you had the court outside the context of any sort of conditional plea procedure asking whether there's any recourse for a defendant who wanted on the one hand to plead guilty and on the other hand to preserve a claim that he was charged under -- he was charged for primary conduct for which he'd already been charged and convicted.","start_time":"3178.88","stop_time":"3228.68","position":"after"}]},{"speaker":"Justice Kagan","mentioned":"Justice Breyer","case_name":"Class v.

Very few defendants have constitutional challenges to the statute under they were convicted that have a reasonable prospect of succeeding on appeal.

So when they were talking about what -- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty plea, they say, well, where you have a right not to be hailed into court at all, they say where the charge is one that the state cannot constitutionally prosecute; that last one is from Menna, and they say where the court had no power to enter the conviction; that last one is from Broce. So, in all three of those cases, the language used is where, you know, in the end you find that the -- that you've -- you've -- you've done the facts, you've satisfied the elements, but still the state can't prosecute you constitutionally or properly.

And, third, I don't think anything that this Court said in Blackledge and Menna reflects that they're really the tip of the iceberg that would allow claims by all sorts of defendants. In those cases, you had the court outside the context of any sort of conditional plea procedure asking whether there's any recourse for a defendant who wanted on the one hand to plead guilty and on the other hand to preserve a claim that he was charged under -- he was charged for primary conduct for which he'd already been charged and convicted.","start_time":"3178.88","stop_time":"3228.68","position":"after"}]},{"speaker":"Justice Roberts","mentioned":"Justice Breyer","case_name":"Class v.
