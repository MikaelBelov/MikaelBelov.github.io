Wold","text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When  a plaintiff brings a Section 1983 malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, the plaintiff must show that the alleged malicious prosecution resulted in the plaintiff's seizure, as this Court held in Thompson. The Sixth Circuit correctly concluded that Petitioner  cannot make that showing because probable cause supported his detention. Petitioner was arrested and detained for three days pursuant to a warrant supported by probable cause for two first degree misdemeanor crimes, each carrying a sentence up to six months imprisonment. In light of that, the presence of a third charge, allegedly lacking probable  cause, could not have resulted in Petitioner's detention.","start_time":"2218.83","stop_time":"2269.19000005","position":"after"},{"speaker":"Megan M. Wold","text":"This result flows directly from existing Fourth Amendment precedents, including Devenpeck versus Elford and Whren versus United States, which make clear that a seizure does not violate the Fourth Amendment \"as long as the circumstances viewed objectively justif y that action.\" Or, as those precedents also state, Fourth Amendment reasonableness allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances, whatever the subjective intent an arresting officer is alleged to have had. Moreover, in Baker versus McCollan, the Court concluded that a three-day seizure like Petitioner's did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the arrest and detention was pursuant to a warrant supported by probable cause, even though police in that case had actually detained an innocent individual based on a mistaken identification. Applying the correct Fourth Amendment rule here means setting aside the charge that Petitioner alleges to have lacked probable cause and assessing whether the remaining charges objectively justify his detention.","start_time":"2269.19000005","stop_time":"2335.05","position":"after"}]},{"speaker":"Justice Kagan","mentioned":"Justice Sotomayor","case_name":"Chiaverini v.

In this context, we understood Respondents to be making an argument about the Appropriations Clause in particular, and the Fifth Circuit found that they hadn't separately raised a non-delegation challenge. You know, I guess what I would say is that to the extent the Court is thinking about this from the perspective of general separation of powers principles, the -- the things that the Court generally consults in understanding the structural provisions of the Constitution are, first, the text, and, second, the history. Those indicators of intent here are overwhelmingly on our side. And then, if the Court is thinking about it from delegation principles, I think there too you would have to look at history. And as Justice Scalia emphasized in his concurring opinion in Clinton versus City of New York, if you look across the course of history from 1789 on, it has been, in the appropriations context, marked by very broad delegations of authority to the executive branch to spend within the bounds set by Congress. And the very first appropriations laws were structured like this one in the sense of providing that the executive could spend up to a -- a cap that was set by Congress itself. So I think that, you know, the cleanest way to think about the arguments Respondents are presenting is under the Appropriations Clause, but I recognize that as the Court is thinking more broadly about these issues, the other doctrines could come into play.","start_time":"1031.49","stop_time":"1117.31","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Elena Kagan","text":"General, could I -- could I take you back to the line of questioning that you and Justice Gorsuch were talking about?

Obviously, with respect to each of these challenged features, we think we have a wealth of evidence regarding standing appropriations or appropriations up to a particular cap. But I don't want to lose sight of the fact that if the Court were to approach this issue looking at the combination of features, this is not novel, and I -- I want to try to unpack a little bit why that's so, because Justice Alito had asked me a couple of questions about the source of the funding and, in particular, about the idea that maybe the line that got crossed here or the relevant difference in how the CFPB is funded is because it draws its funds from the Federal Reserve Board. And I think the reason why that doesn't work and why it shows that this is not unprecedented is that the whole theory behind that premise is that that's a constraint on other agencies.","start_time":"1985.225","stop_time":"2037.335","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Elizabeth B.

But that's not accurate as a descriptive matter with respect to things like the Federal Reserve Board itself, which regulates and assesses money on the Federal Reserve Banks required to stay in the system. They can't leave. And if the overall value here is to determine does the agency have some limiting check on the overall amount of funds, the CFPB is far more constricted because it has a statutory cap actually imposed by Congress rather than regulated entities. And I think, if the Court is looking at all of the features together, maybe some things subtract out Congress a little bit, but the cap adds in Congress in a very powerful and major way that I think distinguishes this appropriation for purposes of congressional control.","start_time":"2037.335","stop_time":"2081.27","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Elena Kagan","text":"Thank you.","start_time":"2081.27","stop_time":"2082.21","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

So I appreciate that there's a world in which insurance contracts are different and they're ordinarily run by the states and each state has a particular interest, consumer protection, not, or whatever, but if our entire kind of framing is about ensuring predictability and uniformity, why would we have a world in which we would allow different state policy interests to be driving the exception in this way?","start_time":"3356.735","stop_time":"3426.25","position":"mention"},{"speaker":"Howard J.

Now that methodology, again, goes well deep into the technical support documents, in part because the EPA engaged in a sort of capacious way of talking about the methodology, but it's there.  And the ozone transport policy analysis goes down the details of how the c ost threshold is specific to the mix of states that goes into it.  And when that shifts, the EPA has an obligation to assess why it matters or why that cost threshold is still reasonably applied to any remaining states.  It has not done so.  This is  -- the burden is on the EPA to consider the inflexibilities that it introduced into the plan, and it has failed to do so, and it continues to stick its head in the sand by failing to go back to the drawing board.","start_time":"992.275","stop_time":"1052.11","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

And it  --it does seem to me you want to -- the term \"stuff,\" sometimes referred to as vehicle issues, there are just a lot of them here, right?  There's the question of did you have to comment and did you comment?  Then there's the question of, well, even if you couldn't comment but  --because you didn't know enough, should you have filed a motion for reconsideration?  And you didn't file a motion for reconsideration.  Then there's this very complex issue about how your question relates to the validity of the SIP disapprovals themselves because, if the SIP disapprovals were valid, you wouldn't have a leg to stand on here.  So how are we supposed to know that in this posture?  So I guess what I'm saying is there are so many hoops that you have to go through and you have to go through all of them.

Instead, Congress has created a new thing to supplement that private scenario or maybe it's brand new in any event, but it doesn't -- it's not a common-law-rooted kind of thing that is being brought in court -- I mean, sorry, brought in the administrative agency with all the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised.","start_time":"5580.47","stop_time":"5670.56","position":"mention"},{"speaker":"S.
