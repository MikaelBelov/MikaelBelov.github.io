Second, with respect to potential discrimination between collectors of government-backed debts and collectors of other debts, the distinction that we've pointed to is that the collection of government-backed debts implicates the distinct federal interest in protecting the federal fisc, and it's not unusual for Congress to prefer federal debt collection efforts. For example, if Congress says the federal government can collect debts owed to it by offset on a tax return -- a tax refund or Social Security benefits, the private predators can't do that, or if the federal government has greater capacity to garnish wages, that there's nothing problematic about that, that the last thing we would say is collectors of private debts could petition the FCC for an exception.

And so maybe the Little Sisters will have to reconfigure their operations, but there's just nothing that they can do that will allow them to come into compliance with the plan, and so -- with -- with the government's mandate. And -- and I think that's what Congress had in mind with RFRA, because they understood that when people are faced with a government obligation that their religion absolutely forbids them to comply with, that's something that the government should try to avoid at all costs. To answer the second part of your question just quickly, the Little Sisters have never complied with the mandate throughout this entire litigation, and so what that means is two things. One, no one will lose their coverage that they have now if the Little Sisters are given this exemption, and, two, throughout that process, we have not heard of even a single employee who views this as a problem, presumably because many of these employees, even if they're not Catholic, because the Little Sisters hires on a non-discriminatory basis, but they've come to work for the Little Sisters understanding the mission of the Little Sisters, and I don't think they would really want to put the Little Sisters in the position that you alluded to of maybe having to stop serving the elderly poor.","start_time":"2290","stop_time":"2400","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

But I think, second, to the extent that we're talking about Congress's goal here, there is abundant evidence that what Congress was trying to do was to create an agency that precisely, because of its desire to protect consumers, was insulated from political control to the fullest extent possible. As Elizabeth Warren, who was really the progenitor of the CFPB, said at the time, if Congress did not create an agency with functional independence, \"my second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.\" And so, if this Court is considering what the hypothetical Congress -- what Congress would have hypothetically wanted at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act, I don't think that what Congress would have wanted was the creation of an agency that was fully subject to the President's control.","start_time":"635.96","stop_time":"720.2","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

So the whole point of the special needs standard is to ensure that others, including prosecutors, can't unnecessarily impede the President in carrying out his responsibilities. So, at a minimum, they have to show that they really need the information that they're seeking, since, if you have 2300 prosecutors that are unnecessarily hitting the President with subpoenas and none of them can actually show they really need that information, you're necessarily going to be undermining the President's ability to effectively carry out the Article II duties that the Constitution entrusts to him and to him alone on behalf of the entire country.","start_time":"2906.52","stop_time":"2963.64","position":"after"}]},{"speaker":"Justice Roberts","mentioned":"Justice Thomas","case_name":"Trump v.
