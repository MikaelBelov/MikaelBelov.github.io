Now you had suggested that there's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal, an -- and that's true, but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision, and so the HEROES Act isn't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute.

The Board has pointed to cases in which it didn't actually raise immunity in the Title 3 context, and until now, the government seemed to have some discomfort with hanging the case on that ground. So just the PROMESA abrogation question I think is, at a minimum, very complicated and, if anything, tilts in our favor given that there is language even under a clear statement rule that you cannot explain under the other side's view unless there is some abrogation for constitutional violations of the type here. Again, it would be even more curious to think that PROMESA, while giving the Board lots of other powers in many other respects, sub silentio essentially overruled the Puerto Rico constitution and its structural waiver of immunity for all of the other parts of Puerto Rico's government and that that was not something that could be brought against the Board.","start_time":"3173.055","stop_time":"3235.675","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

And I don't think it would be reasonable, given the differences in the statutory structure, to say, well, that's not available in Title VII, but we're still going to say that the ADA case law carries its full meaning. Instead, what you'd have to do is start over, and you could use significant difficulty and expense, but at that point, you recognize that there's daylight between the statutes and it's a content-less standard.

And, of course, in the Anderson case in the Ninth Circuit, this was so -- this was considered to be such a systematic problem in the state of California that a suit was actually brought against the State of California to order the State of California to actually force the ALJ orders to be presumptively enforceable because nursing homes would be told under the state-level administrative process that they needed to take someone back and then they wouldn't. And it is very difficult to think of this as a comprehensive remedial scheme when the remedy for being involuntarily evicted from your home by a nursing home is to go back to that place where you fear retaliation potentially, where if -- if you were involuntarily transferred in, for instance, the context of this case because you were being abused, you don't want to go back.

We're advancing a different argument, and I think this is the thrust of where your -- your concern is -- is directed, which is that if our claim is based on providing generalized assistance to the terrorist enterprise, where does that end? And let me say that that's not a question that arises merely under our standard. It arises under the government's standard because the government's formula on page 34 includes channeling, directly channeling, substantial amounts of money to ISIS, and the exact same problem would arise there. We think that the appropriate way of addressing that situation is to understand the remoteness issue in -- standard in Halberstam to refer not merely to remoteness in -- in space but to remoteness in time, and that would have been true in -- in the Halberstam case. If -- if there came a point when Hamilton stopped doing the books, let's say, Quicken came along and Welch wasn't using her assistance anymore, there would come a point when it had been too long since she was playing much of a role and she would no longer be liable. So we -- we would suggest -- we would suggest that the standard include remoteness in time, weighed together with the volume of activity, and that -- that would address that problem.

But, more importantly, Congress actually considered this exact excuse in the transition rules following IIRAIRA, where Congress gave the executive two years, saying, if the executive in any given 1226 case believes it simply does not have the enforcement ability, doesn't have the resources, that will excuse mandatory detention.
