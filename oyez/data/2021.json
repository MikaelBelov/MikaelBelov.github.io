And when the City of Austin denied the application for signage transformation into digital signage, it specifically said you are a non-conforming billboard because of your off-premises commercial speech, and that was the basis for the denial.

And if the Court is trying to decide do we need strict scrutiny here when we have a law of the generality of off-premises/on-premises, its pedigree and its acceptance in this Court's decisions under intermediate scrutiny for 50, 60 years now, without a vanishing of ideas and the vibrancy and flourishing of signage, should give the Court some comfort that it's on the right track if it reads Reed exactly for what Reed said.

And so, in our view, all that the Court needs to do here is to say, as Justice Kagan suggested in her concurring opinion in Reed, that this digitization ban does not survive either strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny if the Court doesn't want to provide guidance on the question of whether on-premises/off-premises distinctions are subject to strict scrutiny across the board. And, in our view, because of the examples that we have given, I think that it is clear that an on-premises/off-premises distinction that turns on whether or not a sign advertises on-premises or off-premises activities is a paradigmatic example of a regulation that distinguishes between different types of communicative content. We've talked about the example of a church that is limited in the speech that it can display on a sign on its premises, but I think many of the other examples that we have discussed today really drive home the extent to which this is a distinction based on content.

The question is whether we should treat a trigger of religious speech or political speech or speech by Republicans or speech by Democrats or all the kinds of triggers that we understand to be dangerous and -- and -- and that we understand to be content-based as we have always used that label, whether that trigger should be treated in the exact identical way as the trigger in this law, which is, does it advertise off-premises activities?

A federal law enforcement agent entered private property without a warrant and used excessive force, just like the federal agents in Bivens, as the Court's questions have indicated. The fact that the federal agent inquired about the visa status of Mr. Boule's guest in the process does not make this case any different from the other instances of law enforcement overreach in the search-and-seizure context in which this Court has long recognized that a Bivens remedy lies. And this case has none of the foreign policy or extraterritoriality concerns that animated the Court's decision in Hernandez. Instead, this is a case like the Court observed in -- in Abbasi, where Bivens has continuing force and even necessity. Mr. Boule's First Amendment claim addresses conduct that is similar to the conduct that this Court assumed in Hartman versus Moore could be remedied via Bivens, but even if it is a new context, there is no reason to withhold the remedy here. There's no national security considerations, no conceivable national security considerations with regard to the First Amendment claim, and no alternative administrative remedial scheme that exists. Awarding damages for federal officer -- individual damages for federal officer misconduct has long-standing roots dating back to the founding and remains appropriate, albeit more limited, today.

First, one of the reasons that the Court in Buckley gave for why expenditure limits were no good was that a candidate's own expenditures on his campaign will typically reduce the likelihood of corruption because the candidate will be less dependent on outside contributors for the -- the running of the campaign. And -- and a loan, to the extent that it can be repaid with post-election contributions, really has the opposite effect. It causes the candidate to be more dependent on outside contributors not just for running the campaign but for his own personal financial well-being. And the other thing I would say is the -- the Court set in Buckley a -- a limit on the amount of money that you can spend on campaign speech is de facto a limit on the amount -- amount of speech that you can engage in because, in the -- even in the 1976 modern world, let alone the -- the current world, effective electoral speech requires expenditures of money, and so a limit on expenditures limits speech. Here, the impact is much more attenuated and uncertain; that is, when they say that speech will be suppressed, what they mean is some number of candidates will be less willing to lend money to their campaigns or will be willing to lend less money and, as a result, fewer funds will be available to the campaigns to engage in speech. There may be some marginal effect of that nature, but it's much less direct and immediate than a limit on the amount of money that the candidate can actually spend.","start_time":"1944.2","stop_time":"2039.9","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

And that -- that -- that's -- that's a big concession given that, for hundreds of years, defendants have gone into court and said, somebody else did it or I wasn't there or I acted in self-defense, as Mr. Crawford himself said, or as Mr. Raleigh said, I didn't participate in this plot, and then the out-of-court statement said, yes, you did. Since the beginning of the criminal law, defendants have defended themselves in ways that out-of-court statements could be introduced to directly contradict their test -- their -- their own defense, and the common law up to the founding and 200-plus years since the founding has always kept those statements out absent an opportunity for cross-examination.","start_time":"1078.64","stop_time":"1144.25","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Samuel A.

Instead, in the cases where the Court has looked at those kinds of consequences, it has always identified a conflict with other express statutory language, a conflict with other statutes that Congress has enacted that directly addressed the issue at question, or a conflict with the entire structure of the statute such that it would be unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted it. And it's only been in those situations where the Court has identified a textual and structural problem with the agency's interpretation in the beginning, using those traditional tools of statutory construction, that the Court has then gone on to say that its interpretation of the statute is confirmed by the economic and political consequences that would ensue. So I think it would be a sea change for this Court to reverse the order of operations as the Applicants are asking for here and to start off by asking does this seem like it has economic and political consequences, and it would ultimately do a disservice to principles of the separation of powers and to -- to Congress's ability to have its clear statutory enactments, even if they're broad, given the effect that they have.","start_time":"6364.48","stop_time":"6451.035","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

And in the very next sentence, the Court said: But, of course, the legislature, if it wanted to, could regulate the carrying of that firearm publicly. And then, when you turn to laws like the ones that we have here, which include some sort of self-defense exception, either ex-ante or ex-post, the trend in the cases is in favor of -- of upholding their constitutionality. We've cited about six decisions from the 1800s and the early 1900s, including the Duke and English cases from Texas, the Isaiah case from Alabama, the Haley and Fife cases from Arkansas, and the Workman case from West Virginia, all of which upheld those laws. And Mr. Clement's answer to those decisions is that they rested on the erroneous understanding that the Second Amendment or its state equivalents protected only the right to use arms in the militia.

It's just it's -- it's nothing that looks like the kind of thing that's suitable for bilateral arbitration. And since Congress protected the ability of parties to agree to bilateral arbitration, no matter how much California thinks it's got a better way to do things, it just has to yield when it comes to people who are parties to arbitration agreements. As to other people, as to employees who are not subject to the FAA and the like, they can have their policy, and, subject to the Due Process Clause, there's not much my clients can do with it, about it.

Well, this Court, in Grupo Mexicano, said, specifically speaking about an expansion from a post -- a post-judgment creditor's ability to distraint a debtor's assets, moving to a pre-judgment creditor's ability to do so, that was simply too great of a novel equitable innovation for this Court to be able to permit itself to essentially innovate.
