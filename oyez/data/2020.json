And that is the distinction that we think that the language of the force clause captures. But I would make one additional point that I have not made to date, and that is that even if you think that the \"against\" phrase doesn't do all of the work, I would submit that this Court's decisions, and particularly its decision in Begay, do the remainder of the work because they make clear that the relevant language must be understood in its statutory context, which is to provide a definition of the phrase \"violent felony.\" And where someone acts recklessly, even though the law obviously attributes to that person a substantial degree of moral culpability, that action simply doesn't fall within the ordinary meaning of \"violent felony.\" And the second point I would make, Justice Breyer, is that whatever you might think about sort of the fine gradations in particular hypotheticals, I would respectfully submit that it would be a lot harder to draw the line between recklessness and criminal negligence because negligence itself in the model penal code is defined as being a -- a -- a situation in which an actor should be aware of, once again, a substantial and unjustifiable risk.

First of all, I -- I think the different contexts actually cut in our direction because, first of all, they removed the Second Amendment concerns that Justice Thomas voiced in his dissenting opinion in Voisine. And -- and, second -- the second point I would make is that, here, you require three serious felony offenses, whereas, there, a single misdemeanor crime would have sufficed. And as I was suggesting earlier, we're talking about cases where people have been charged with felony assault or -- or murder or robbery or a serious offense like that, and we're not simply talking about cases where one crime makes all the difference. And the third -- the third thing I would say is that, if you hold for Petitioner in this case, I think you're going to reintroduce the exact same anomaly that you avoided in Voisine. As we explain on page 36 of our brief, the similarly worded elements clause in 18 U.S.C. 16, which defines crime of violence, is incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act's definition of crime of domestic violence. And if these reckless crimes are excluded, then the 35 state misdemeanor assault offenses that the Court focused on in Voisine wouldn't qualify under the Immigration and Nationality Act either. And I think it would be quite surprising to Congress to find that a fairly subtle change of wording, one statute requiring that the crime be committed by a domestic relation and the other statute requiring that it be against the person of another, make that big a difference as to whether the scheme works as it was intended to.","start_time":"3323.41","stop_time":"3432.395","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Elena Kagan","text":"Thank you, Mr. Feigin.","start_time":"3432.395","stop_time":"3433.81","position":"before"},{"speaker":"John G.

And as the Court and the United States' amicus in that case said, that would be an -- an -- a very oblique way of attempting to overturn the settled body of law. The settled body of law comes from what a practitioner looking at nine unanimous circuits over 50 years would think at the time, and that is that where there is a federal officer or civil rights assertion and other issues, the only issue that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review are those issues, and that's what Congress ratified by reenacting the language and only adding \"1442 or.\" There was also -- and -- and -- and we cite to the House report, which -- which points out that the reason for this addition was specifically to protect federal officers from removal, as civil rights cases do because, otherwise, there is no way to get the issue into the court of appeals.

I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some -- some -- whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some -- some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not.","start_time":"3180.88","stop_time":"3300.09","position":"mention"},{"speaker":"Sonia Sotomayor","text":"They didn't do anything.

Sims already held that you don't need to raise those issues to the Appeals Council. And so lots of questions, like whether a consultative expert should have been called or how the ALJ conducted questioning, are already in district court for the first time, and there is -- doesn't seem to be any problem, and the agency hasn't created a rule since Sims suggesting there isn't a problem. With respect to the futility issue, I don't take the government to be suggesting at any point in time that the agency would have ever been competent to adjudicate Appointments Clause challenges. Now they made that collusive in January 2018 when they told ALJs specifically to say they had no power to entertain such claims, but I don't think that was in question before then, and cases like Free Enterprise, as well as Eldridge and Califano in the Social Security context, underscore that such constitutional questions seem well beyond the agency's competence to adjudicate.","start_time":"590.71","stop_time":"664.09","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Stephen G.

Under Miller, the court must consider whether the distinctive attributes of youth have diminished the penological justifications for life without parole. When, as in this case, the court determines that they have not, that is a determination that the crime does not reflect transient immaturity, and no further finding is required.

But, to take your point on the statutory question for a moment, it's also notable that other times that Congress has spoken to the issue, it has understood that sometimes it wanted the statutes to include state land and sometimes it didn't and sometimes it excluded them, which, if it was true that every industry going through state lands was going to need this power, well, then it would be very strange to see those inclusion -- exclusions.","start_time":"3852.74","stop_time":"3900.69","position":"before"},{"speaker":"Jeremy M.

Similarly, the remedies that vary from one state or other imposing on plans that very often are natural -- national plans mean that employees of the same company will have unequal benefits from one state to another and plans will have to have -- either plans themselves or using the third-party administrators that they have appointed as agents to administer the plan on their behalf -- different procedures and different remedies and different update schedules in every different state, which themselves frequently change. And many, many of these requirements will turn -- will require the plans to either change their summary plan of benefits, their explanation of benefits when it turns out that the beneficiary has to pay more in Mississippi because of some requirement that applies after an appeal procedure, or to tell people, for example, look, you're a driver for J.B.

Harris","text":"So the distinction, I think, comes from the idea that they are both final decisions that deny someone benefits or deny someone whatever they're asking on a reopening claim.

Harris","text":"It's not committed to agency discretion by law. And the reason is you can figure out that there's something that hasn't been presented to the agency before that might change the outcome, and it would be inequitable not to let someone litigate that and get judicial review of that type of decision, whereas the rehash type of claim does, as in Sanders, raise potential concerns about circumvention of the limitations period. So it's sort of a combination of the sense of what is a final decision, but also the other step of is it the kind of final decision that -- that courts can review in a meaningful sense?

I think the second example that you gave, which kind of is a liability-type example, in actuality, a lot of courts don't allow product liability-type cases to proceed as a class because individualized damages tend to -- tend to make the named plaintiff not typical or run afoul of other Rule 23 considerations.
