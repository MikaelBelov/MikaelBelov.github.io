So even if you think it was wrongly decided as an original matter, it's got significant practical benefits, its practical problems are manageable, it's been on the books for decades, and this is something that Congress could fix if it believed that this Court has misgauged legislative intent in adopting the Seminole Rock doctrine.","start_time":"2708.36","stop_time":"2788.08","position":"after"},{"speaker":"Brett M.
